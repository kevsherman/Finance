<h1>Hello Lighthouse Labs!</h1>

<p>This is my first web app attempt, based on problem set 7 from Harvard Online's CS50 course (Fall 2013).</p>

<p>It's not much to look at, but it is a decent demonstration of my newfound HTML, CSS, PHP, and mySQL skills.
I developed it locally, using MAMP, iTerm, Sublime Text 2, Git and Github </p>


<h2>TO DO:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>stocks with zero shares to delete from db - COMPLETE</li>

<li>Fix login page - only render navbar and footer when logged in - COMPLETE</li>

<li>add bootstrap styling to all templates - COMPLETE</li>

<li>add buy button to displayquote - COMPLETE</li>

<li>When buy button clicked, use user data from stock look-up to prepopulate buy field</li>

<li>Calculate total value of holdings (securities + cash) - COMPLETE</li>
</ol>
